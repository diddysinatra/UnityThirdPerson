Thank you for supporting hyenApp!


** Installing the Necronodicon **
1. Aways backup your work before updating or installing the Necronodicon!
2. Pleas make sure your using the latest version of uScript! Some of these nodes require uScript RB23 or newer!
3. Double click the ( hyenApp - Necronodicon 1.0.5.unitypackage ) to install all or some of the Necronodicon custom nodes into your current Unity project, you may have to restart the uScript Editor for the new nodes to show up.

NOTE: Pleas try to use official uScript nodes when ever possible! The Necronodicon custom nodes that have become deprecated can be downloaded from the ( http://www.uscript.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1841 ) if you should need them.
